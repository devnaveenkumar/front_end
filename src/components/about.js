      <h3>Hey, Naveen here. I'm an enthusiastic Software Developer.
      <br />
      It has been an interesting journey so far. Check out my blog to read more about my life. <br />
      Now, coming back to the professional part of my life, I'm obsessed with computer and programming. <br />
      <br />
      I have developed a fair amount of both simple and complicated applications.
      <br />
      I'm more interested in machine learning and neural networks.
      <br />
